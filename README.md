CURRENT PROBLEMS
the program is currently broken and we're working on a large fix. it is unknown if this fix will break/undo progress. the 5/11 bug is the biggest bug we've experienced so far. 
After a long period of time with lazy programming, all the syntax, string errors, and others have finally caught up to us. a large patch will be pushed after I make a pre-5/11-patch to check back if anything breaks
